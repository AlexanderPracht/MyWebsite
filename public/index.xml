      <description>General Social Survey (GSS)The General Social Survey (GSS) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.
In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS sample data, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.</description>

      <description>Climate change and temperature anomaliesNot everyone understands that the world is heating up…
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;/img/twitter_trump.jpg&amp;quot;, error = FALSE)Click here to see this post on twitter.
But we will see in the following analysis that there is a trend of global warming…
If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</description>

      <description>On this page I would like to analyse the current flight schedule of Lufthansa Cargo. I downloaded the data directly from the Lufthansa Cargo Website. I chose Lufthansa Cargo because it is a German company and their data is publicly available on their webpage. It would be interesting to conduct this study also for other airlines in order to determine which airlines are more confident compared to others about the future in the light of Corona.</description>

      <description>What Yiel Curves Can Predict…Yield curves of US treasuries show the different yields for different maturity dates.We looked at US data and used the FRED database. Although we have the yields for maturities between 3 months and 30 years, we would like to focus on only two of them:1. 3-Month Treasury Bill2. 10-Year Treasury Rate
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency# to see, eg.</description>
