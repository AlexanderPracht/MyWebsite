knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;/img/twitter_trump.jpg&amp;quot;, error = FALSE)But we will see in the following analysis that there is a trend of global warming…
Climate change and temperature anomaliesIf we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here</description>

Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.
In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS sample data, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.</description>

library(ggplot2)library(maps)library(rgeos)## Loading required package: sp## rgeos version: 0.</description>

      <description>What Yiel Curves Can Predict…Yield curves of US treasuries show the different yields for different maturity dates.We looked at US data and used the FRED database. Although we have the yields for maturities between 3 months and 30 years, we would like to focus on only two of them:1. 3-Month Treasury Bill2. 10-Year Treasury Rate
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency# to see, eg.</description>
